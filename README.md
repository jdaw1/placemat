# Placemat
Makes placemats for tastings of Port, of Madeira, whisky, beer, wine, etc.

You and your lucky guests are to enjoy a tasting of a fine beverage &mdash; perhaps Port, perhaps whisky, perhaps something else. 
Of course, there will be many glasses, each person having one for each drink to taste. 
It is important to avoid confusion about what is in each glass. 
Hence labelling is needed, best done with beautiful printed pages on which glasses can sit. 
And having done that, there might also be need for matching pages:  
* on which to write tasting notes,  
* to label decanters and bottles,  
* to organise pre-pouring,  
* to display the corks,  
* to label each person&rsquo;s place-setting (so everybody knows who everybody else is, even late in the tasting),  
* to record votes for the Wine Of The Night, and  
* to assist with computing the split of the costs, allowing for bottles provided.

This PostScript program creates all the paperwork useful for managing such tastings, large or small.

Code started November 2002 for the private use of J.&nbsp;D.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;Wiseman; in September 2005 uploaded to jdawiseman.com; in January 2021 transferred to GitHub.
